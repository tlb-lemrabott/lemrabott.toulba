### Main Tasks

- Implemented a scalable service with Node.js, REST APIs, and PgAdmin4 to connect the bankâ€™s internal payment platform with an external insurance provider. 
- Increased scalability 40% and reduced latency by implementing asynchronous messaging with RabbitMQ.
- Used Java, Spring Boot, Angular, and AWS Cloud to build and deploy a full-stack web application that served as a tool for the accounting team to experiment with the pricing of the bankâ€™s services for clients.
