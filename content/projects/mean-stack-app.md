## Description
The [**Language Learning Platform**] is a full-stack web-based application developed as part of my PHP project for the MWA course. The platform was developed using the **MEAN Stack** technologies, and it aims to provide a comprehensive resource for individuals interested in learning new languages. It offers a curated collection of books for each language, along with ratings and feedback from users.

## Key Features: 
- Language Documentation: The platform includes a document that lists various languages and their associated countries. Users can explore different languages and gain insights into their cultural and geographical contexts.

- Book Recommendations:* For each language, the platform offers a collection of books specifically chosen to aid language learning. Users can browse through the recommended books, which include titles, authors, and prices, helping them make informed decisions.

- User Ratings and Feedback:* The platform allows users to rate and provide feedback on the books they have used for language learning. This feature enables learners to benefit from the experiences and recommendations of others within the community.

- Expandable Database: Initially, the project focuses on two or three languages with a selection of two or three books each. However, as the project progresses, the database can be expanded to include more languages and a wider range of resources.


## Technologies Used:
- Angular: Front-end framework for building the user interface.
- Node.js: For server-side application development and handling HTTP requests.
- Express.Js: A Node.js framework for building robust APIs.
- MongoDB: As the NoSQL database for storing and managing housing-related data.
- JWT: For authentication and authorization of API endpoints.
- Docker: For containerizing and managing the MongoDB Server.
- REST API: For defining the API endpoints and interactions.
- Postman: For manual and automated API testing and validation.

It provides an opportunity for users to explore new languages, connect with others, and make informed choices in their language learning journey.
