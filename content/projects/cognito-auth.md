## Description
This project demonstrates a complete user authentication workflow using Amazon Cognito, providing a user-friendly interface for login, error handling, password change enforcement, and home page access post-login.
> üõ°Ô∏è Authentication Approach Used: This implementation follows the Backend-Managed Authentication model. The front-end sends login requests to a backend server, which securely communicates with AWS Cognito to handle authentication, token management, and session control.

## üß© Key Features:
- **Login Interface**: Users are prompted to enter their username and password to log in. The login form is designed for simplicity and clarity.

- **Error Handling:** "User Not Found", If a user enters a username that is not registered in the Cognito User Pool, an appropriate error message is shown.

- **Error Handling:**  "Incorrect Password", When an incorrect password is entered for a valid username, the interface displays an error message informing the user.

- **Force Password Change**: If Cognito requires the user to change their password (e.g., after an admin reset or first login), the user is redirected to a password change form after entering valid credentials.

- **Successful Login & Home Page Access:** Upon successful login (and password change, if required), the user is redirected to the home page, where authenticated content is accessible.

- **Secure Backend Integration**: The front-end sends login requests to the backend, which interacts securely with AWS Cognito for token handling, session management, and authentication validation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used:
- **ReactJS**: For hadling routing to Cognito interface and Home page.
- **AWS Cognito**: Handles user authentication, password policies, and token generation.
- **Spring Boot**: Backend server for secure communication with Cognito (Backend-Managed Authentication model).
- **OAuth2 and JWT**: For session control and secure access to protected routes.
- **Responsive UI/UX**: Ensures optimal usability with clear feedback and guidance during login.

This blog post covers:
- Direct UI Integration with AWS Cognito API using front-end SDKs like AWS Amplify.
- Backend-Managed Authentication, where your backend handles user verification and token management.
- Cognito Hosted UI a quick, fully managed solution using AWS‚Äôs built-in login interface.

Each method is explained with its pros, cons, and best use cases, helping you choose the right fit for your app‚Äôs architecture and security needs.

## Conclusion:
This project delivers a real-world example of secure login flow integration with AWS services. Through clean UI, robust error handling, and backend integration, it demonstrates best practices in backend-managed based authentication ensuring a smooth, informative, and secure user experience across all login scenarios.
